🚀 Building Games with Amazon Q CLI – My Experience Creating Tic-Tac-Toe with Pygame

As a Python developer with a passion for game development, I recently explored Amazon’s Q CLI — and let me tell you, it’s a game changer (pun intended).

To put it to the test, I challenged it with a prompt to generate a fully functional, two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game using Pygame. What I got back was not just code — it was a structured, readable, and cleanly implemented solution that I could immediately run, tweak, and share.

🧠 The Prompt I Used:
I started with a straightforward yet detailed prompt, aiming to test the depth of Q CLI's ability to build real-world games:

"Generate a complete Python script for a two-player 'Tic-Tac-Toe' game using the Pygame library. The game should include [...] features like a clickable 3x3 grid, player turns, win/draw conditions, and a reset option."

And just like that, I had a working game.

🎮 Game Features Delivered by Amazon Q CLI:
✅ Clickable 3x3 Game Grid
✅ Clear Player Turn Indicators (X and O)
✅ Mouse Input Detection
✅ Win/Draw Condition Handling
✅ Endgame Messages (“Player X Wins!”, “It’s a Draw!”)
✅ Keyboard Reset Option (Press R)
✅ Clean Visuals Using Basic Pygame Graphics
✅ Structured Game Loop with Event Handling

The code followed good design practices, handled edge cases (like clicking on an already-occupied cell), and was neatly modular — a perfect starting point for both beginners and those looking to build on a classic concept.

💡 What I Learned:
Using Amazon Q CLI, I realized just how efficiently developers can accelerate idea-to-execution time. With the right prompt, Q CLI doesn’t just write code — it collaborates. It understands structure, logic, user interaction, and clean syntax.

As someone who’s been handcrafting Python games for years, this felt like working with a supercharged co-pilot.
